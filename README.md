<h1>Security Audit</h1> 

This tutorial elucidates the critical significance of conducting a comprehensive security audit and implementing robust security measures within an organization. The focal point of our discussion is a fictional toy company grappling with pressing security deficiencies and a need for strict adherence to compliance regulations.<br /> 

<h2>Steps </h2> 

- Company Scope and Goals: This allows the security auditor to review and assess the goals and scope of what needs to be implemented to ensure that the company is compliant and has the appropriate security controls in place.

- Risk Assessment: A risk assessment is determining what the risks of the company are and mitigating the risks.

- Compliance Checklist: This checklist is important to know the regulations that the company needs to adhere to.

<h2>Analysis of Scope and Goals</h2> 
It's very important that an IT department reviews the current assets of the company and how they are managed. Some of the most important assets of a company are:

-  Internet Access/Network

-  On-premise equipment for office needs
  
-  Vendor access management
  
-  Management of systems, software, and services

There are many more that can be added to a company's assets, but these will be used to just name a few.

  

<h2>Controls Assessment</h2> 
After analyzing the scope, goals, and assets for the company, you will want to conduct a controls assessment. This assessment will allow the security auditor to determine which controls need to be implemented immediately or in the future. There are three types of controls:

- Administrative: these controls are what employees of the company must attest to such as policies and procedures.

- Technical: these controls are what the organization uses to protect their networks and data such as intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and etc.

- Physical: these controls are surveillance cameras, cabinet locks and etc. to protect physical locations, such as retail stores or offices.

After completing the controls assessment, you will want to complete a compliance checklist to ensure that you are adhering to regulations by building your policies and procedures based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the U.S. Department of Commerce.
